# 📐 Generative Math

A web application built with NextJS, Tailwind, OpenAI, MongoDB & Auth0 to generate code and responses to mathematical statements. 🚀

## 🎯 Features

- User authentication with **Auth0** 🔐
- Input mathematical problems or statements as `context` 💡
- Generate solutions using the **text-davinci-003** model from OpenAI 🧠
- Store and retrieve generated solutions from **MongoDB** 🗄️
- Ongoing improvements to GUI, deployment, and migration to **LLMs models** 🚧

## 📝 Instructions for Use

1. **Log in:** Enter the application by logging in through **Auth0** 🔐
2. **Input problem:** Use the main screen to input a given problem (`context`) 💡
3. **Generate solution:** The system generates a request to the **text-davinci-003** model, saves the result as a record in **MongoDB**, and retrieves the record to display the problem solution in an appreciable way 🧪
4. **In progress:** Work continues to improve the GUI, deploy the project, and migrate from **LLMs models** 🚧

Happy problem-solving! 🎉
